Hi, I'm **David**.  

I am currently working as a Senior Data Science Consultant at [esentri](https://www.esentri.com/author/david-schoenleber/), where I work across the full data science stack: I build and deploy machine learning solutions, design and implement data science and analytics infrastructures in the cloud, and generally help companies create real value through data. As a result, I strongly believe that an "end-to-end mindset" is key to the success of data science and machine learning projects.

Before joining esentri, I honed my industry tech skills by working as a data analyst with the big data cloud tech stack (AWS) at a performance marketing company called [msales](https://msales.com/).

I studied physics at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en) ([B.Sc.](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_1246571/component/file_1246570/content), [M.Sc.](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_1859538_1/component/file_1859537/content)) and subsequently did my [PhD]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/docs/thesis_ds.pdf %}) at the [Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems](https://www.pks.mpg.de/) in Dresden. In my research, I studied the dynamics of quantum mechanical systems with many degrees of freedoms by performing numerical simulations, mathematical modeling, optimization, and data analysis.  
During my PhD I realized that working in the area of data science / AI would provide me with the flexibility that I wanted while allowing me to follow my passion for solving complex problems using analytical and computational methods. Consequently, I shifted my research focus in my PostDoc and applied machine learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks or Gaussian Process Optimization to physical systems.

If you want to know more about my physics research, visit my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=de&user=HtdjK8kAAAAJ) as well as my hidden but still available [PhD website](https://www.pks.mpg.de/~dslr/research.html).
